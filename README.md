# Conversational AI Assistant (Google Ecosystem-Powered)
This project is a Conversational AI Assistant built entirely on Google's ecosystem of APIs, delivering a seamless voice-based user experience. It combines natural speech recognition, intelligent language understanding, and voice response — all accessible via an intuitive Gradio interface.

# 1. Google Speech-to-Text API
Captures and transcribes real-time microphone input using Google’s high-accuracy STT (Speech-to-Text) engine — ensuring fast and robust voice command recognition.

# 2. Google Gemini 2.5 Flash
Empowered by the Gemini 2.5 Flash model, this assistant intelligently processes user prompts to:
1. Generate natural conversations
2. Interpret intent
3. Make context-aware decisions
4. Interface with third-party APIs when needed

# 3. Google Text-to-Speech (GenAI SDK)
Converts Gemini’s generated responses into human-like speech using Google’s Text-to-Speech GenAI SDK — enabling a smooth conversational flow via spoken feedback.

# 4. Google Calendar API Integration
Integrated with the user’s Google Calendar, this assistant can:
1. Fetch and read out upcoming events
2. Create new calendar events via natural language commands

# 5. Gradio UI Wrapper
All components are beautifully packaged within a Gradio-based web interface, allowing users to:
1. Interact with the assistant via microphone and speaker
2. Visualize waveform outputs
3. Manually control actions like start, stop, and send
